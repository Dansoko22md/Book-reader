		<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
			sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the
			book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what
			is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversations?"</p>

		<p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the day made her
			feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be
			worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit
			with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
