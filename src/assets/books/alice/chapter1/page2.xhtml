		<p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so
			<a id="Page_1" class="pageno" title="[Pg 1]"></a>very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit
			say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" But when the Rabbit actually
			took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice
			started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a
			rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with
			curiosity, she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it pop down a
			large rabbit-hole, under the hedge. In another moment, down went Alice after it!
		</p>

		<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly
			down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before
			she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.</p>
