		<p>Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass. There was nothing on
			it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that this might belong to one of
			the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too
			small, but, at any rate, it would not open any of them. However, on the second time
			'round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a
			little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, and
			to her great delight, it fitted!</p>

		<p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger
			than a rat-hole; she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden
			you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those
			beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
			through the doorway. "Oh," said Alice, "how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I
			think I could, if I only knew how to begin."</p>
